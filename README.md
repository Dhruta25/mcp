How it works

The server uses SQLite database
FastMCP helps me create tools that any MCP app can use
You can access this server from your local device using a connector

⸻

Public MCP Server Link

I deployed this server on FastMCP Cloud
Anyone can access it using this link

https://expense-tracker-dhruta.fastmcp.app/mcp

This link is my live MCP server
You can connect it to your own device and use all tools

How to use this MCP server on your local device

This section is for complete beginners
Follow step by step and it will work

⸻

Step 1

Download Claude Desktop on your device
Claude Desktop supports MCP connectors
After install open Claude

Step 2

Go to settings in Claude Desktop
Inside settings find the option called MCP
This is where we add connectors

Step 3

Click Add New Connector
Now you will see two fields
Connector Type
Connector Path or URL

Select MCP Remote Server or similar option
Paste my server link in the field

https://expense-tracker-dhruta.fastmcp.app/mcp

Save it

Step 4

Claude will now connect to my Expense Tracker MCP automatically
You will see all tools like
add_expenses
update_expenses
delete_expenses
list_expenses
calculate_total
filter_by_category

Now you can start asking Claude
like
Add a new expense
Show total expense
Delete expense on this date
and more

Everything will work because the connector is linked to my MCP server
